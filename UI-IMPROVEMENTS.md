# UI Changes Summary

## ðŸŽ¯ **Compact Interface Improvements:**

1. **Removed Fixed Height**: No longer takes up full screen height (`height={process.stdout.rows - 1}`)

2. **Minimalist Header**: 
   - When ready: Just shows "ðŸŽ­ Title (model)" on one line
   - When loading: Shows loading state with spinner

3. **Smart Instructions**: 
   - Only shows shortcuts when no messages exist yet
   - Hides automatically once conversation starts

4. **Compact Messages**:
   - Removed extra margins and spacing
   - Messages flow naturally downward
   - System status messages are filtered out

5. **Natural Growth**: Interface starts small and grows organically as conversation develops

## ðŸš€ **Result:**

- **Before**: Large box taking up entire terminal height with lots of empty space
- **After**: Compact interface that starts minimal and grows only as needed

Perfect for quick back-and-forth conversations without visual clutter!
